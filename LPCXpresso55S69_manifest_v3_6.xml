It shows how to implement lightweight core to core communication using FreeRTOS Message Buffers, which are lockless circular buffers that can pass data packets of varying sizes from a single sender to a single receiver. The primary core releases the secondary core from the reset and then the inter-core communication is established then. Once the Message Buffers are initialized on both cores the message exchange starts, incrementing a virtual counter that is part of the message payload. The message pingpong finishes when the counter reaches the value of 100. The Message Buffer is deinitialized at the end. NXP Multicore Manager (MCMGR) component is used for several purposes in this example: - it releases the secondary core from the reset (starts the secondary code) - it registers and use the application event for init handshaking (the secondary core application signals to the primary core it is ready to communicate) - it registers and use the FreeRtosMessageBuffersEvent for inter-core interrupts triggering and interrupts handling. Shared memory usage: This multicore example uses the shared memory for data exchange. The shared memory region is defined and the size can be adjustable in the linker file. The shared memory region start address and the size have to be defined in linker file for each core equally. The shared memory start address is then exported from the linker to the application to allow placing FreeRTOS Message Buffers at a fixed location that is then known for both cores." toolchain="armgcc" compiler="compiler_gcc" category="multicore_examples" linked_projects="lpcxpresso55s69_freertos_message_buffers_cm33_core1" path="boards/lpcxpresso55s69/multicore_examples/freertos_message_buffers/cm33_core0">

However, in actual low power use case, to save energy and reduce the consumption even more, many things can be done including: - Disable the clock for unnecessary module during low power mode. That means, programmer can disable the clocks before entering the low power mode and re-enable them after exiting the low power mode when necessary. - Disable the function for unnecessary part of a module when other part would keep working in low power mode. At the most time, more powerful function means more power consumption. For example, disable the digital function for the unnecessary pin mux, and so on. - Set the proper pin state (direction and logic level) according to the actual application hardware.

These descriptors are cycled from one to the other.Things to note- The descriptors of the ping pong transfer need to be aligned to size 16- The inital transfer will perform the same job as first descriptor of ping pong, so the first linkeage is to go to g_pingpong_desc[1]- g_pingpong_desc[1] then chains the g_pingpong_desc[0] as the next descriptor- The properties are set up such that g_pingpong_desc[0] (and the initial configuration uses INTA to signal back to the callback)- g_pingpong_desc[1] uses INTB to signal to the callback- The scheduled callback uses this information to know which data was last writtenA note on PerformanceThe intent of this example is to illustrate how a double-buffer scheme can be implemented using the dma. The performance of this example will be limited to how quickly the echo printer can read-out the data from the ping pong buffer and display it. This means that the example will work well if characters are entered at a rate where the DMA callback to echo the string can keep up with the input stream. Connecting the USARTRX to a continuous fast speed will cause the DMA to fall behind.
